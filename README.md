# PASSAR TUDO PRA INGLES

# 1. Business Problem.

House Rocket, located in seattle, is a company specialized in buying and selling real estate, with its profit on it

Currently, real estate choices are made manually by a team of company specialists, however, due to the complexity and cost of evaluating the profit potential of a property with so many options in the portfolio, the company has an extremely unpredictable cash flow, driving investors away. 

# 2. Business Assumptions.

The assumptions about the business problem is as follows:

- The National Realtors Association forecasts that sales prices of existing homes will average $ 218,500 this year, 5% higher than the $ 208,000 of 2014, and that new and existing home sales might reach 5.83 million in 2015, higher than in any year since the recession.
- The national Case-Schiller index tracks repeat-sales home prices across the country. It reflected national price growth of 1.3% in 2012, 9.6% in 2013 and 6.6% in 2014.

# 3. Solution Strategy

My strategy to solve this challenge was:

**Step 01. Data Description:** My goal is to use statistics metrics to identify data outside the scope of business.

**Step 02. Feature Engineering:** Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.

**Step 03. Data Filtering:** Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

**Step 05. Convert Analysis to Business Values:** Convert the analysis that i´ve do into a business result.

**Step 6. Deploy Modelo to Production:** Publish the model in a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision.
